> Asynchronous node.js wrapper for the UnRTF RTF conversion program

## Intro

[UnRTF](https://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/) is a CLI program that allows for the manipulation and extraction of data from RTF documents such as converting RTF files to HTML or TXT.

The `node-unrtf` module provides an asynchronous node.js wrapper around this CLI program for easier use.
It was originally created out of a need for a RTF-to-HTML conversion module at [Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust](https://yeovilhospital.co.uk/) to convert clinical documents in RTF format to HTML.

## Installation

Install using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-unrtf):

```bash
npm install node-unrtf
```

Or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/node-unrtf):

```bash
yarn add node-unrtf
```

node-unrtf's test scripts use npm commands.

### Linux and macOS/Darwin Support

A Windows binary (v0.19.3) is provided with this repository.
For Linux and Mac users, you will need to download the `unrtf` binary separately.

An example of downloading the binary on a Debian system:

```
sudo apt-get install unrtf
```

For macOS, the binary can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install unrtf
```

Once they have been installed, you will need to pass the `unrtf` installation directory in as parameters to an instance of the UnRTF class:

```js
const { UnRTF } = require("node-unrtf");
const unRtf = new UnRTF("./usr/bin");
```

## API

```js
const { UnRTF } = require("node-unrtf");
```

[**API Documentation can be found here**](https://github.com/Fdawgs/node-unrtf/blob/master/API.md)

## Examples

### Async Await

Example of an `async` `await` call to convert an RTF file to HTML, and then output the result to console:

```js
const { UnRTF } = require("node-unrtf");

const file = "test_document.rtf";
const unRtf = new UnRTF();
const options = {
	outputHtml: true,
};

const res = await unRtf.convert(file, options);
console.log(res);
```

### Promise Chaining

Example of calling unRTF.convert with a promise chain:

```js
const { UnRTF } = require("node-unrtf");

const file = "test_document.rtf";
const unRtf = new UnRTF("./usr/bin");
const options = {
	outputHtml: true,
};

unRTF.convert(file, options).then((res) => {
	console.log(res);
});
```
