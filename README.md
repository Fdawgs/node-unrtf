> Asynchronous Node.js wrapper for the UnRTF RTF conversion program

## Overview

[UnRTF](https://gnu.org/software/unrtf/) is a CLI program that allows for the manipulation and extraction of data from RTF documents such as converting RTF files to HTML or TXT.

The `node-unrtf` module provides an asynchronous Node.js wrapper around said CLI program for easier use.

## Installation

Install using `npm`:

```bash
npm i node-unrtf
```

### Linux and macOS/Darwin support

For Linux and Mac users, the `unrtf` binary will need to be installed separately.

An example of downloading the binary on a Debian system:

```
sudo apt-get install unrtf
```

For macOS, the binary can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install unrtf
```

## API

API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Fdawgs/node-unrtf/blob/main/API.md).

## Example usage

### Async Await

Example of an `async` `await` call to convert an RTF file to HTML in an ESM environment:

```js
import { UnRTF } from "node-unrtf";

const file = "test_document.rtf";
const unRtf = new UnRTF();
const options = {
	outputHtml: true,
};

const res = await unRtf.convert(file, options);
console.log(res);
```

### Promise chaining

Example of calling unRTF.convert with a promise chain in a CJS environment:

```js
const { UnRTF } = require("node-unrtf");

const file = "test_document.rtf";
const unRtf = new UnRTF("/usr/bin");
const options = {
	outputHtml: true,
};

unRTF
	.convert(file, options)
	.then((res) => {
		console.log(res);
		return res;
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.error(err);
		throw err;
	});
```

### Removing images generated by UnRTF

As mentioned in the note block at the top of this README, the `noPictures` option does not remove images
when used with UnRTF < v0.20.4 and will write them to the current working directory.
To remove images generated by UnRTF it is recommended to use a globbing module such as [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) in conjunction with the `node:fs/promises` module to find and remove them:

```js
import { unlink } from "node:fs/promises";
import { UnRTF } from "node-unrtf";
import { glob } from "glob";

const file = "test_resources/test_files/test-rtf-complex.rtf";
const unRtf = new UnRTF();
const options = {
	outputHtml: true,
	noPictures: true,
};

await unRtf.convert(file, options);

const files = await glob("*.{emf,wmf}");
await Promise.all(files.map((filed) => unlink(filed)));
```
